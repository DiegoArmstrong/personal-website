# My Personal Website

The link above in the about section will take you to my website which includes my social links, project portfolio, resume, experience, education, etc. This page is mostly intended for career purposes but is also a great place to start for anyone who wants to make their own personal website. If you really like mine, please feel free to download the code and use it for yourself! Making a website can be a long process so I hope this repo also serves as a time-saver for anyone who wants it.
